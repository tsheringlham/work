            <h2>Learning method</h2>
         <p><img src="s.jpg" >The words we use to describe what our brains do show fine shades of meaning.
        In this lesson, we will look at several terms that are  often confused, and learn how learning, knowledge, performance, memory, and cognition are differen
        While there are disciplinary differences in what students learn, it is important to keep in mind that learning content or information constitutes only one part of learning in 
        university courses. Regardless of the field of study, students need to have significant opportunities to develop and practice intellectual skills/thinking processes (e.g. problem-solving, scientific inquiry), motor skills and attitudes/values that are important to their fields of study. 
        In addition, students need opportunities to develop interpersonal and social skills (often referred to as soft skills) that are important for professional and personal success. Examples of these skills include teamwork, effective communication, conflict resolution and creative thinking. 
        As teaching assistants and instructors, we need to keep in 
        mind that there is much more to learning than content and that we should pay attention not only to the content but also to thinking processes and other types of learning.</p> 
        
        
        
        <p><img src="p.jpg" alt="image3">The word learning is used routinely in discussions about teaching in higher education, so itâ€™s important to clarify what we are referring to when we talk about learning.<img src="k.jpg" alt="image4">  
            Educational researchers agree that learning is much deeper than memorization and information recall. Deep and long-lasting learning involves understanding, relating ideas
            and making connections between prior and new knowledge, independent and critical thinking and ability to transfer knowledge to new and different context</p>

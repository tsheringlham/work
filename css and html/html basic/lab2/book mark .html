        One day, a stranger called Man turns up at the house, asking for a room and claiming to be a local doctor. Him readily agrees, 
        and Mother reluctantly follows suit. 
        Late that night, Man suffers from dry heaves and Mother observes a wound on his side.
        Time passes. Mother prepares for the arrival of the child and reads Him's beautiful new poem. Upon publication, it is acclaimed and
         sells well. In celebration, Mother prepares a big dinner, but a group of fans interrupt. Though she asks Him to send them away, 
         he insists he has to be polite and show his appreciation. Mother tries to lock the doors, but droves of fans pour into the house
          and begin to wreak havoc, stealing things as souvenirs and damaging the house. Due to the adulation he is receiving, Him is oblivious
           to what is happening, but a disoriented Mother watches helplessly as military forces turn up to battle members of the cult that has 
           sprung up around Him and as his publicist organizes mass executions. 
        Mother goes into labor and finds Him, who reopens his study, which he had previously boarded up, so she can give birth inside.

        The lighter that appears throughout the film bears the Wendehorn, a pseudo-runic symbol that represents "the cooperation between nature's eternal laws,
         working in effect and in accordance with each other."
         The havoc outside subsides. Him checks outside and finds that they have left gifts. Him tells Mother that 
         the people are simply waiting; upon her prompting, he leaves to tell them to leave. When he returns, 
         Him tells Mother his fans want to see their newborn son. She asks why he won't make them leave, and he reveals he doesn't want them to.
          She refuses to hand over the boy to Him. Eventually, she falls asleep, and Him takes the child outside to the crowd, which passes the 
          baby around wildly until he is inadvertently killed. Mother wades into the throng and finds people eating her son's mutilated corpse.
           Furious, she calls them murderers and attacks them with a shard of glass. They turn on her and beat her savagely until Him intervenes. 
           He begs Mother to forgive them, but she runs down to the basement oil tank and punctures it with a wrench. She ignites the oil,
          causing an explosion that incinerates the crowd and destroys the house.

        Him, Man, and Woman take the injured son to the hospital. Alone in the house, Mother cleans up and notices
        strange damage to the house, including a fly, a frog, and blood that will not stop dripping. 
        other! was the first of Aronofsky's films without the involvement of composer Clint Mansell.[13]
         It initially had a score composed by Jóhann Jóhannsson, but after seeing the 90-minute score synced up with a rough cut of the film,
          Aronofsky and Jóhannsson agreed not to use it. They tried using the score at only a few moments, then a minimal version of the score 
          with sound design by Craig Henighan, incorporating noises into the soundscape of the house. They ultimately decided the film worked
           best with no music.
        [14] Composer Ólafur Arnalds recounted the following story about this decision:

         She asks him what he is, and he replies, "I am I" and Mother was "home." He asks for her love, and, when she agrees,
         reaches into her chest and removes her heart, which he tears open to reveal a new crystal object. He places it on the pedestal 
         and the house is transformed back into a beautiful home.
         A new Mother appears in the bed and awakens, wondering aloud where Him is.
         Aronofsky responded to the film's CinemaScore rating by saying that Mother! was meant to be difficult viewing for audiences: 
         "How if you walk out of this movie are you not going to give it an 'F'? ... We wanted to make a punk movie and come at you. 
         And the reason I wanted to come is because 
         I was very sad and I had a lot of anguish and I wanted to express it."[31]
